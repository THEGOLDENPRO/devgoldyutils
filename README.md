## Stop using this library!
**This library has now been deprecated!** It was created by me 4 years ago during my early days of programming. Back then I thought it would be a good idea to create a library that bundles some functions and classes I will commonly use in other projects such as `LoggerAdaptor` and `add_custom_handler`, but over the years more and more reasons arised to **not** rely on this library. Such as the library abstracting away very simple methods and me figuring out smaller and much more compact code snippets.
